For people unaware, you can control the Kodi media player remotely through your Android device.
To use Kodi from your Android device, you will have to configure Kodi and use one of the remote Android apps for Kodi.
To configure Kodi for remote access, go to System->Settings->Services->Web Server and enable “Allow remote control via HTTP”.
Then, go to the “Remote Control” tab below “Web Server” and enable “Allow remote control by programs on other systems”.

Kodi Remote Access
The aforementioned configuration should be good enough for Kore, which is the official Remote app for Kodi but if you want to use some other remote app like Yatse,
 you will have to configure some other options. In System->Settings->Services, go to “Zeroconf” and enable “Announce services to other systems”.
 Then, go to “UPnP/DLNA” option and enable both “Share my libraries” and “Allow remote control via UPnP”.
 This configuration should make sure that Yatse works seamlessly.
